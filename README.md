# coursera-ml-python
This repository contains python implementations of all the exercises from the course by Andrew Ng. For most of the code in this repository I have instead used existing Python implementations like Scikit-learn but most of the places all the codes have been written from scratch.

# Topics Covered so Far
<p>
The topics covered so far are-<br><ol>
<li><b>Linear Regression</b> in one variable and multiple variable. Datasets which are used are the ones provided in the course plus some exisiting dataset downloaded from other site.</li><br>
<li><b>Logistic Regression</b> with single class classification. The model is provided with two training sets one which is used without regularization and one which is used with the help of the regularization.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Multiclass Classification and Neural Networks</b></li> Implemented the first problem using sklearn logistic regression function and the second requirement which was building the neural network in plain python code using a bit of  help from numpy.
